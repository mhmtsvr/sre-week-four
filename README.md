# Helm Guide

- You can run the command below to get the list of all Helm releases in your cluster and their release numbers

    ```
    helm list -a -n sre
    ```

- Run the command below to get a historical overview of the Upcommerce release

    ```
    helm history upcommerce -n sre
    ```

- When you have gotten the release numbers, you can rollback to the stable release using the command below (replace <release_number> with the actual number of the release you want to roll back to):

    ```
    helm rollback upcommerce <release_number> -n sre
    ```

- To confirm that things have been rolled back, please run any one of the commands below:

    ```
    helm list -a -n sre
    helm history upcommerce -n sre
    ```

    ```
    helm ls -n sre    # List all releases (deployments).
